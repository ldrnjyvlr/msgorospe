# Forgot Password Setup Guide

## Overview
The application now includes a complete forgot password functionality with Gmail confirmation. Users can reset their passwords through a secure email-based process.

## Features Added

### 1. ForgotPassword Page (`/forgot-password`)
- Clean, user-friendly interface matching the app's design
- Email input validation
- Success confirmation with instructions
- Automatic redirect to login after email sent

### 2. ResetPassword Page (`/reset-password`)
- Secure password reset form
- Password strength validation (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Password confirmation matching
- Success confirmation with auto-redirect to login

### 3. Updated Login Page
- Added "Forgot Password?" link with icon
- Maintains existing functionality

### 4. Updated Routing
- Added routes for both forgot password and reset password pages
- Properly integrated with existing authentication flow

## How It Works

1. **User requests password reset**: User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page
2. **Email submission**: User enters email address on forgot password page
3. **Supabase sends email**: System sends password reset link via Gmail
4. **User clicks link**: Email contains secure link to reset password page
5. **Password reset**: User sets new password with validation
6. **Success**: User is redirected to login with new password

## Technical Implementation

### Supabase Integration
- Uses `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` for sending reset emails
- Uses `supabase.auth.updateUser()` for updating passwords
- Automatic session handling with tokens from URL
- Secure token validation and expiration

### Security Features
- Password strength requirements
- Secure token handling
- Session validation
- Error handling for expired/invalid links
- Auto-redirect after successful reset
